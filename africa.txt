Africa: From Ancient Kingdoms to Post-Colonial Nations

Africa, humanityâ€™s origin, saw early societies like Egypt (3100 BCE) build pyramids and establish trade. Kingdoms like Kush, Axum, and Ghana (4th-13th centuries) thrived on gold and salt routes. The medieval Mali Empire (13th-15th centuries) under Mansa Musa was a cultural and economic powerhouse. European exploration (15th century) led to the slave trade and colonization (19th century), dividing Africa into colonies under Britain, France, and others.

Independence waves (1950s-1970s) created modern nations, but many faced conflict, debt, and AIDS. The late 20th century brought democratization and economic growth, with innovations like mobile banking. Today, Africa leads in population growth and renewable energy potential, balancing tradition and modernity amidst challenges like climate change and governance issues.
