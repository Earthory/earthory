East Asia: Dynasties to Tech Giants

East Asia’s history starts with China’s Shang Dynasty (1600 BCE), known for bronze and writing. The Han (206 BCE-220 CE) and Tang (618-907 CE) dynasties expanded culture and trade. Japan’s feudal era (12th-19th centuries) saw samurai and shoguns, while Korea developed its own dynasties. Mongol invasions (13th century) and Qing rule (17th-20th centuries) shaped China.

Western influence (19th century) brought colonization and trade wars, but Japan’s Meiji Restoration (1868) modernized rapidly. The 20th century saw revolutions (Chinese, 1911), wars (Sino-Japanese, 1937-1945), and economic miracles (Japan, South Korea). Today, East Asia leads in technology, manufacturing, and geopolitics, facing demographic and environmental shifts.
