Southeast Asia: Ancient Kingdoms to Regional Cooperation

Southeast Asia’s early kingdoms, like Funan and Khmer (1st-14th centuries), thrived on trade and Buddhism. The Majapahit (13th-15th centuries) and Ayutthaya (14th-18th centuries) empires dominated regionally. European powers (16th-19th centuries) colonized, with Spain, Portugal, and Britain exploiting resources. Japan’s WWII occupation (1941-1945) spurred nationalism.

Independence (mid-20th century) brought diversity, with nations like Indonesia and Vietnam facing communism and conflict. The late 20th century saw ASEAN’s formation (1967), driving trade and stability. Today, Southeast Asia balances economic growth, tourism, and environmental challenges.
