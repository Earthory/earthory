North America: From Indigenous Peoples to Global Power

North America’s history starts with Indigenous peoples who thrived for millennia, building societies like the Maya, Aztec, and Iroquois. By 1492, these cultures developed agriculture, trade, and monumental architecture, such as Cahokia’s earthworks. European arrival in 1492, led by Columbus, introduced colonization, with Spain, France, and England establishing settlements like Jamestown (1607) and Plymouth (1620). The Columbian Exchange brought crops and diseases, decimating Indigenous populations, while colonial economies relied on slavery and indentured labor. By 1776, thirteen colonies declared independence, sparking the American Revolution and establishing a democratic republic.

Westward expansion (19th century) displaced Indigenous groups via policies like the Trail of Tears (1830s). The Erie Canal (1825) and railroads drove industrialization, while the Civil War (1861-1865) ended slavery but deepened regional divides. Urbanization and inventions like the steam engine and telegraph transformed society. The 20th century saw North America, especially the U.S. and Canada, emerge as global powers after World Wars I and II. The Cold War (1947-1991) and space race showcased technological prowess, with innovations like computers and the internet. Today, North America leads in technology, culture, and politics, facing challenges like inequality and environmental change.
