Latin America: Ancient Civilizations to Modern Challenges

Latin America’s history begins with advanced civilizations like the Maya, Aztec, and Inca, who built cities, pyramids, and trade networks before 1492. These societies excelled in astronomy, agriculture, and governance, with capitals like Tenochtitlán and Machu Picchu. European conquest started with Columbus (1492), followed by Spanish and Portuguese colonization, exploiting gold, silver, and labor through encomienda systems. The Columbian Exchange reshaped ecosystems, while colonial rule imposed Catholicism and hierarchical societies.

Independence movements (19th century) liberated nations like Mexico (1821) and Brazil (1822), but instability followed, with caudillos and economic dependence. The 20th century saw revolutions (e.g., Cuban, 1959) and military dictatorships, alongside economic booms from oil and agriculture. Today, Latin America faces challenges like inequality, drug trade, and climate vulnerability, but also cultural richness and regional cooperation through organizations like CELAC.
