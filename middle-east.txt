Middle East: Cradle of Civilization to Modern States

The Middle East, home to early civilizations like Sumer and Egypt (3000 BCE), saw innovations in writing, law, and irrigation. Empires like Akkadian, Babylonian, and Persian rose, with trade routes linking East and West. Alexander the Great (4th century BCE) and Roman rule followed, but the regionâ€™s cultural peak came with the Islamic Golden Age (8th-13th centuries), marked by science, art, and scholarship in Baghdad and Cordoba. Mongol invasions (13th century) and Ottoman rule (14th-20th centuries) shaped its trajectory.

Colonialism (19th-20th centuries) by Britain and France redrew borders, creating modern states like Iraq and Syria. Oil discovery (20th century) fueled wealth but also conflict, with wars (e.g., Arab-Israeli, 1948-present) and revolutions (e.g., Iranian, 1979). Today, the region grapples with political instability, terrorism, and resource competition, while preserving rich cultural heritage.
