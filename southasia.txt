South Asia: Ancient Empires to Digital Hubs

South Asia’s history begins with the Indus Valley Civilization (2600 BCE), known for urban planning and trade. The Maurya (4th-2nd centuries BCE) and Gupta (4th-6th centuries CE) empires brought Buddhism and science. The Mughal Empire (16th-19th centuries) unified the region, building monuments like the Taj Mahal. British colonization (18th-20th centuries) exploited resources, leading to the 1947 partition into India and Pakistan.

Post-independence, South Asia faced wars, poverty, and nuclear rivalry, but also economic booms (e.g., India’s IT sector). Today, it’s a cultural and economic powerhouse, balancing tradition, democracy, and globalization challenges.
